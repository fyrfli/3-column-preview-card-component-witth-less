## My process

I decided to redo this challenge using LESS and timing myself. It took me a lot longer than I wanted it to because there are still some things I need more practice with. The idea is to start using frameworks to help with my coding. Tailwindcss looks fast and easy but ultimately I much prefer LESS because I get to define my own variables and feels more flexible to me at this point. Probably because I need a LOT more practive with Tailwind but for now I am happy just working with LESS.
